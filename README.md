- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kenneth Legg 
- I am working on my LIS 575 Project 
- I'm confused, but getting more comfortable. 
- After checking out the many different options for the Final Project, I think I am going to go for Project 2B(v). 
- I want to produce a simple eBook and see how that comes out. Google Sites also looks very interesting.
