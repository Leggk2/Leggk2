I have a link and am underway on working on the Google Sites page. I am excited but much more interested in the eBook and seeing how that goes. 
4/21 - Experimenting with usability. There are a lot of interesting tools that Google Sites provides that would make the user's experience much easier. It 
is definetly geared towards social media/Google based apps such as YouTube, Google Docs etc. The Map and Calendar features are very simple to use and a site
for a restuarant/bar/small business would find a very easy time creating a web page to advertise. I am thinking I will create several pages under the main site 
showing examples of how different entities (businesses, schools, etc) could use Google Sites to create web pages.
