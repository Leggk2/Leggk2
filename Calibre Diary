4/24 - Getting all set up with Calibre and starting the eBook. Looked through some eBooks that I've read in the past to get 
ideas on layout etc. 
Started with the html set up, and working on a CSS file to give the book a more interesting, appealing look. 
Beginning with background and font colors to make the book stand out a bit more and be easier to read depending on the device used. Often times 
black text on white background can be very bright, so I am trying a grey background to make it a bit warmer. 
Next I am working on adding several chapters and will add pictures to each.
