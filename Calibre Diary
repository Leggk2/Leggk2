4/24 - Getting all set up with Calibre and starting the eBook. Looked through some eBooks that I've read in the past to get 
ideas on layout etc. 
Started with the html set up, and working on a CSS file to give the book a more interesting, appealing look. 
Beginning with background and font colors to make the book stand out a bit more and be easier to read depending on the device used. Often times 
black text on white background can be very bright, so I am trying a grey background to make it a bit warmer. 
Next I am working on adding several chapters and will add pictures to each. 
4/26 - The book is coming together so far, got bogged down in the Google Sites today, but had the idea of embeding the eBook into the Google Site example
of a private library. 
5/1 - Finishing up the Calibre eBook, having difficulty making up content to fill some chapters, but I'm adding each to the table of contents 
and added a free use image from pixabay.com for the cover image. I'm amazed at how easy calibre makes adding different pieces of the puzzle to the eBook.
